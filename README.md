# Pizza Booking CUI Application
• This project aims to develop a console-based application in Java utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, Collection Framework, and File Handling to facilitate the booking and management of pizza orders. The application will be developed using Eclipse as the primary Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

• Upon restarting the console-based application, the stored user data can be retrieved due to the implementation of the collection framework and file handling within the system.

• After the order is finalized, a bill will be generated in TXT format and stored within the system.
